# Proposal: Decentralized Professional Network

Synopsis: A proposal for a decentralized application that allows professionals to build, own, and control their personal network, making it portable and independent of any single employer or platform.

Key Takeaways:

- Problem Identification: Professionals often lose their network contacts when changing jobs because the data is stored in corporate-owned CRMs.
- Proposed Solution: A decentralized tool where users own and control their network data, making it portable between different roles and companies.

- Core Functionality:
  - The network is not tied to a specific company or platform, ensuring portability.
  - It integrates with the user's phone for direct communication.
  - It is designed as a private tool for managing trusted contacts, not a public social media platform for brand awareness.

- Target Audience: The tool is intended for all professionals, from employees moving between jobs to business owners.

- Ownership Analogy: Users are building their own asset ("land") rather than renting space on a third-party platform like Facebook.
