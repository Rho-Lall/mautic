- **Rate Limiting**: IP-based throttling to prevent abuse
- **Error Handling**: Secure error responses without information leakage
- **HTTPS Enforcement**: All communications encrypted in transit

### üìä Monitoring & Observability
- **CloudWatch Integration**: Real-time API usage monitoring
- **Custom Metrics**: Security-focused performance indicators
- **Automated Alerting**: Suspicious activity detection
- **Audit Logging**: Complete request/response tracking
- **Dashboard Visualization**: Security metrics and trends

### üõ°Ô∏è Infrastructure Security
- **Encryption**: Data encrypted at rest (DynamoDB) and in transit
- **IAM Policies**: Least-privilege access controls
- **VPC Integration**: Network isolation capabilities
- **Resource Tagging**: Organized security governance
- **Terraform IaC**: Reproducible, auditable infrastructure

### üîç Security Headers Implementation
```javascript
// Security headers configured in API Gateway responses
{
  'X-Content-Type-Options': 'nosniff',
  'X-Frame-Options': 'DENY',
  'Content-Security-Policy': "default-src 'self'",
  'Strict-Transport-Security': 'max-age=31536000',
  'X-XSS-Protection': '1; mode=block'
}
```

        CloudWatch Monitoring & Alerting
```

### Security Layers
1. **Edge Security**: CloudFront with security headers
2. **API Gateway**: CORS, throttling, request validation
3. **Application**: Lambda input sanitization and validation
4. **Data**: DynamoDB encryption and access controls
5. **Monitoring**: CloudWatch logs and custom metrics

## Production Security Considerations

For production deployments, consider implementing:

### Authentication & Authorization
- API key management for protected endpoints
- JWT tokens for user session management
- Multi-factor authentication for administrative access
- Role-based access control (RBAC)

### Advanced Threat Protection
- AWS WAF rules for common attack patterns
- DDoS protection via AWS Shield
- Automated incident response workflows
- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)

### Data Protection
- Field-level encryption for sensitive data
- Data retention and deletion policies
- GDPR/CCPA compliance measures
- Regular security assessments

### Network Security
- VPC configuration with private subnets
- Security groups with minimal required access
- Network ACLs for additional layer protection
- VPC Flow Logs for network monitoring

## Security Testing

### Automated Validation
- Input validation testing for all endpoints
- CORS policy verification
- Rate limiting effectiveness testing
- Error handling security validation

### Security Scanning
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Infrastructure security assessment
- Code security analysis
- Configuration security review

## Compliance Framework

### Standards Alignment
- **OWASP Top 10**: Addresses common web vulnerabilities
- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework**: Risk management alignment
- **AWS Well-Architected**: Security pillar implementation
- **SOC 2**: Security controls demonstration

### Privacy Considerations
- **Data Minimization**: Collects only necessary information
- **Consent Management**: Clear data usage policies
- **Right to Deletion**: Data removal capabilities
- **Data Portability**: Export functionality support

## Monitoring & Alerting

### Key Security Metrics
- Request volume and patterns
- Error rates and types
- Response time anomalies
- Geographic access patterns
- Failed request attempts

### Automated Responses
- Suspicious activity detection
- Rate limit enforcement
- Error threshold monitoring
- Performance degradation alerts

## Development Security

### Secure Coding Practices
```javascript
// Example: Secure input handling
const validateInput = (data) => {
  // Input sanitization
  const sanitized = DOMPurify.sanitize(data);
  
  // Length validation
  if (sanitized.length > MAX_LENGTH) {
    throw new ValidationError('Input too long');
  }
  
  // Pattern validation
  if (!VALID_PATTERN.test(sanitized)) {
    throw new ValidationError('Invalid format');
  }
  
  return sanitized;
};
```

### Environment Security
```bash
# Environment variables (never hardcoded)
AWS_REGION=us-east-1
API_GATEWAY_URL=https://your-api-domain.com
DYNAMODB_TABLE_NAME=your-table-name

# Note: Actual values stored securely, not in code
```
