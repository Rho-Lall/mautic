# Requirements Document

## Introduction

A serverless lead capture form system that can be embedded into GitHub Pages websites and deployed on AWS infrastructure. This MVP serves as the foundation for future integration with a Mautic marketing automation server. The system must support both public development repositories and secure private production deployments.


## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a website owner, I want to embed a lead capture form into my GitHub Pages site, so that I can collect visitor contact information without managing backend infrastructure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Lead_Capture_Form SHALL render properly when embedded in any GitHub Pages or other static website
2. WHEN a visitor submits the form, THE Serverless_Backend SHALL process the submission within 3 seconds
3. THE Lead_Capture_Form SHALL validate email addresses before submission
4. THE Lead_Capture_Form SHALL display success and error messages to users
5. THE Embed_Code SHALL be a single JavaScript snippet that requires no additional dependencies

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to deploy the infrastructure using Terraform, so that I can manage AWS resources through code and ensure consistent deployments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Terraform_Infrastructure SHALL provision all required AWS_Services for the serverless backend
2. THE Terraform_Infrastructure SHALL create separate environments for development and production
3. WHEN Terraform applies the configuration, THE AWS_Services SHALL be configured with appropriate security settings
4. THE Terraform_Infrastructure SHALL output the API endpoint URL for form configuration
5. THE Terraform_Infrastructure SHALL include IAM roles with least-privilege access principles

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want separate public and private repositories, so that I can share development code openly while keeping production configurations secure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Public_Repository SHALL contain all source code except sensitive configuration files
2. THE Private_Repository SHALL contain production Terraform configurations and secrets
3. THE Public_Repository SHALL include documentation for local development setup
4. THE Private_Repository SHALL include automated deployment workflows
5. WHERE production deployment occurs, THE Private_Repository SHALL use encrypted environment variables

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the serverless backend to store lead data securely, so that visitor information is protected and accessible for future Mautic integration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Serverless_Backend SHALL store lead data in an encrypted AWS database
2. THE Serverless_Backend SHALL validate and sanitize all form inputs before storage
3. THE Serverless_Backend SHALL implement CORS policies to restrict form submissions to authorized domains
4. THE Serverless_Backend SHALL log all form submissions for audit purposes
5. THE Serverless_Backend SHALL provide an API endpoint for retrieving stored leads

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to be designed for future Mautic integration, so that the lead capture form can seamlessly connect to a full marketing automation platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Serverless_Backend SHALL store lead data in a format compatible with Mautic import requirements
2. THE Lead_Capture_Form SHALL support custom fields that align with Mautic contact properties
3. THE Serverless_Backend SHALL provide webhook capabilities for real-time lead notifications
4. THE AWS_Services SHALL be configured to allow secure communication with external Mautic servers
5. THE system architecture SHALL support adding Mautic API integration without major refactoring
